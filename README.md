# readerrr | a better google reader reading experience
This is a google chrome extension I made 'cause I got tired of Google Reader default skin.

### Release&hellip;
&hellip; can be found [on the chrome webstore](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/readerrr/dljhagpflpblckhpalcondhfnekglcgl)

### Let's make it better together!
- install [foreman](https://github.com/ddollar/foreman)
- `npm install`
- `foreman start` to start the coffee (JS) and stylus (CSS) compiler/watcher
- Google Chrome > Window > Extensions > Load unpacked extension > Folder `extension`

### TODO
- make file for build
